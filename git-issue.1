.SH NAME
git-issue \- distributed issue management system based on Git
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBgit-issue\fP <command> [<arguments>]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIGit-issue\fP manages issues, bugs, tickets, feature proposals
using Git.
Issues are stored as simple text files, which you can be
viewed, edited, shared, and backed up with all text-based tools.

edit issues without requiring online access to a centralized server.
The use of Git gives \fIgit issue\fP a robust, efficient, portable,
and widely available infrastructure.

to support the efficient merging of work, while also providing
a solid audit trail regarding any changes.
