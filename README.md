# git-issue

This is a minimalist distributed issue management system based on Git.
It has the following advantages over other systems.

* **No backend, no dependencies:**
  You can install and use _git issue_ with a single shell script.
  There's no need for a server or a database back-end, and the corresponding
  problems and requirements for their administration.
* **Distributed asynchronous management:**
  Anyone can add, comment, and edit issues without requiring online access
  to a centralized server.
  There's no need for online connectivity; you can pull and push issues
  when you're online.
* **Transparent text file format:**
  Issues are stored as simple text files, which you can view, edit, share, and
  backup with any tool you like.
  There's no risk of loosing access to your issues because a server has
  failed.
* **Git-based:**
  Issues are changed and shared through Git.
  This provides _git issue_ with a robust, efficient, portable,
  and widely available infrastructure.
  It allows you to reuse your Git credentials and infrastructure, allows
  the efficient merging of work, and also provides a solid audit trail
  regarding any changes.
  You can even use Git and command-line tools directly to make sophisticated
  changes to your issue database.

## Installation

### Administrator installation
Clone the repo and run `make install` with appropriate privileges.

### Personal installation
Clone the repo and register a git alias to the `git-issue.sh` script:

```
git config --global alias.issue '!'"${REPO_PATH}/git-issue.sh"
```

If you are using a bash shell, you can also register the autocompletion
by adding the following to your .bashrc.

```
source ${REPO_PATH}/gi-completion.sh
```

### Backward compatibility with the gi command
For backward compatibility you can also use the original *gi* command,
by copying `gi.sh` to someplace in your path.
In this case you must register the git alias to use the auto completion feature.
If you have administrative access you can install it with
`sudo install gi.sh /usr/local/bin/gi`.
For your personal use,
assuming that the directory `~/bin` exists and is in your path,
you can install it with `install gi.sh ~/bin/gi`.
You can even put `gi` in your project's current directory and run it from there.

### Portability and testing
The `git-issue.sh` script has been tested on:
Debian GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, macOS, and Cygwin.
If you're running _git issue* on another system,
run the `test.sh` script to verify
its operation, and (please) update this file.

## Use
You use _git issue_ with the following sub-commands.

### start an issue repository
* `git issue clone`: Clone the specified remote repository.
* `git issue init`: Create a new issues repository in the current directory.
  The `-e` option uses an existing Git project repository.
### work with an issue
* `git issue new`: Create a new open issue (with optional `-s` summary).
* `git issue show`: Show specified issue (and its comments with `-c`).
* `git issue comment`: Add an issue comment.
* `git issue edit`: Edit the specified issue's description
* `git issue tag`: Add (or remove with `-r`) a tag.
* `git issue assign`: Assign (or reassign) an issue to a person.
  The person is specified with his/her email address.
  The form `@name` or `name@` can be used as a shortcut, provided it
  uniquely identifies an existing assignee or committer.
* `git issue attach`: Attach (or remove with `-r`) a file to an issue.
* `git issue watcher`: Add (or remove with `-r`) an issue watcher.
* `git issue close`: Remove the `open` tag, add the closed tag
### show multiple issues
* `git issue list`: List open issues (or all with `-a`); supports tags
### synchronize with remote repository
* `git issue push`: Update remote repository with local changes.
* `git issue pull`: Update local repository with remote changes.
### help and debug
* `git issue help`: Display help information about git issue.
* `git issue log`: Output a log of changes made
* `git issue git`: Run the specified Git command on the issues repository.

Issues and comments are specified through the SHA hash associated with the
commit that opened them.

## Internals
All data are stored under `.issues`, which should be placed under `.gitignore`,
if it will coexist with another Git-based project.
The directory contains the following elements.
* A `.git` directory contains the Git data associated with the issues.
* A `config` file with configuration data.
* A `templates` directory with message templates.
* An `issues` directory contains the individual issues.
* Each issue is stored in a directory named `issues/xx/xxxxxxx...`,
    where the x's are the SHA of the issue's initial commit.
* Each issue can have the following elements in its directory.
  * A `description` file with a one-line summary and a description of the issue.
  * A `comments` directory where comments are stored.
  * An `attachments` directory where issue's attachments are stored.
  * A `tags` file containing the issue's tags, one in each line.
  * A `watchers` file containing the emails of persons to be notified when the issue changes (one per line).
  * An `assignee` file containing the email for the person assigned to the issue.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcomed through pull requests.
Before working on a new feature please look at open issues, and if no
corresponding issue is open, create one to claim priority over the task.
Contributions should pass tests and should be accompanied with a
corresponding test case and documentation update.
Note that to avoid duplicating information, the subcommands, the used files,
and usage examples, are automatically inserted into the script and its
documentation from the `README.md` file using the `sync-docs.sh` command.
